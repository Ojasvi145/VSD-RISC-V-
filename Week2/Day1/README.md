# BabySoC Fundamentals & Functional Modelling

### Objective : 
In week 2 we are going to build a solid understanding of SoC fundamentals and practise functional modelling via BabySoC using simulation tools (iverilog and GTKWave).

## Part 1 : Theory (Fundamentals of SoC Design) 
VSDBabySoC an open source system on chip (SoC) based on RISC-V architecture for digital-analog interfacing. It combines RVMYTH processor , PLL , 10-bit DAC (all implemented using Sky130 technology).
