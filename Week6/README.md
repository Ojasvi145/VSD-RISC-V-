# Week 6 Task – DIGITAL-VLSI-SOC-DESIGN-AND-PLANNING
## Open-source EDA, OpenLANE, and the Sky130 PDK

### Context
The file provides a comprehensive overview of open-source electronic design automation (EDA) with a focus on OpenLANE and the Sky130 process design kit (PDK). It explains the entire digital ASIC design flow from register-transfer level (RTL) design to the final GDSII layout using open-source tools.

Key highlights include:

Introduction to RTL design, EDA tools, and Process Design Kits (PDKs), highlighting the Sky130 PDK as an accessible, cost-effective foundry technology.

Detailed explanation of the OpenLANE automated RTL-to-GDSII flow, which integrates tools like OpenROAD, Yosys, Magic, and Netgen to accomplish synthesis, floorplanning, placement, clock tree synthesis, routing, and sign-off.

Description of OpenLANE’s modes: autonomous (push-button) and interactive (stepwise control), and its usage of multiple design examples for testing.

Importance of physical design stages including power planning, decoupling capacitors, pin placement, and handling antenna rules and timing verification.

Emphasis on quality checks like design rule checking (DRC), layout versus schematic (LVS) verification, and static timing analysis (STA).

Insights into design-for-test (DFT), fault simulation, and formal verification for ensuring chip correctness.

Introduction to standard cell libraries, chip floorplanning concepts, placement optimization, and routing strategies aligned with the Sky130 PDK specifics.

Explanation of outputs like GDSII and LEF files and their role in the chip design process.

Overall, it thoroughly covers the practical steps and considerations for using open-source EDA tools and Sky130 PDK to achieve a manufacturable ASIC design, from initial HDL code to physical tapeout-ready layout
